Flight delays come in many forms. Some appear in the flight tracker at the airport
but also there is a good portion that remain unseen and are 
caused in the last minute (ex. getting catering late to the plane). In this 
project, using a real time flight tracking API, I was able find the airports 
that are currently most delayed. This is done by finding the highest ratio of delayed 
flights/ total flights for all the given airports in the united states during the 
specific day. Using this tracker, I was able to find trends on which days are best to 
fly through which specific airports so that a traveler can minimize the risk of them traveling through a airport that is delayed. 

This program also has other cool features where you can add any airport of your selecting in
the world and compare it's delay time ratio to all of the others in the current airport
catalog in this program.
