Flight delays come in many forms. Some appear in the flight tracker at the airport
but also there is a good portion that remain unseen and are 
caused in the last minute (ex. getting catering late to the plane). In this 
project, using a real time flight tracking API, I was able find the airports 
that are currently most delayed. This is done by finding the highest ratio of delayed 
flights/ total flights for all the given airports in the united states during the 
specific day. Using this tracker, I was able to find trends on which days are best to 
fly through which specific airports so that a traveler can minimize the risk of them 
traveling through a airport that is delayed. 

This program also has other cool features where you can add any airport of your 
selecting inthe world and compare it's delay time ratio to all of the others in the
current airport catalog in this program. 

I am currently keep tracking of all the data from this program on a daily basis on a 
micrsoft excell. That excell will be published once I am done so that everyone can
notice the trends of delays at airports



If you would like to use this code, you will need an access key from https://aviation-edge.com as 
that is where all the data is from.
